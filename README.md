India has the second-highest number of people with diabetes globally, with an estimated 77 million people affected in 2019. According to the same study by the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology, diabetic retinopathy affects over 60% of people with diabetes in India. Therefore, is crucial for dr to be diagnosed both quickly and accurately

They will be able to receive an output in a matter of seconds after filling out the relevant data for each entry. On a single page, all records can be readily shown. Our software also will also have an authentication system
